- Flexbox uses two types of boxes:
1. Flex containers, and
2. Flex items

Flex container:
- group flex items together and define how they are positioned.
- every HTML element that is a direct* child of a flex container is an "item"
- flex items can be manipulated individually but its mainly the container that defines their layout
- flex items lets the container know how many thigns it needs to position
